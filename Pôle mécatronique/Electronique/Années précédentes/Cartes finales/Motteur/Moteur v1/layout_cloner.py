# Script for KiCad Pcbnew to clone a part of a layout. The scipt clones a row or a matrix
# of similar layouts.
#
# For now, there are no command line parameters given for the script, instead all the settings
# are written in this file. Before using this script, you must have your schema ready.
#
# 1. Use hierarchical sheets for the subschemas to be cloned and annotate them 
#    so that each sheet has module references starting with a different hundred.
# 2. Import a netlist into Pcbnew and place all the components except the ones to be cloned.
#    Also create an optimal layout for the subschema to be used as the template for the clones.
#    Surround the layout of the subchema with a zone in the comment layer.
# 3. Save the .kicad_pcb file. Modify SETTINGS at the top of this script to match your board.
#    Run this script.
#
# The script has three main parts:
# First, the script moves the modules, which are already imported into the board file. They are
# moved by a predetermined offset amount compared to the template module. (A module with the same
# reference, except starting with a different hundred, eg. templatemodule = D201, clones = D301, D401, D501 etc.)
# Second, the script clones the zones inside the comment layer zone. It seems the zone to be cloned must
# be completely inside the comment zone. Zones have a net defined for them. The script searches for any
# pads inside the cloned zone and sets their net for the zone. So you may get a wrong zone for the net if
# there are pads with different nets inside the zone.
# Third, the script clones the tracks inside the comment zone. Any track touching the zone will be cloned.
# Tracks do not have nets defined for them so they should connect nicely to the modules they will be touching
# after the cloning process.
#
# This script has been tested with KiCad versions 4 and 5.
